# What is this project about?

This is my attempt to make a minimal crm application geared towards business that provide solar power installations and perhaps other contractors.

## Version 0.0.1

Building this using NextJS, Tailwindcss and shadcn/ui


## Intended Features

1. Lead Management: CRM software can help in capturing, tracking, qualifying, and managing potential customers for services like solar power and gas geysers installation.

2. Appointment Scheduling: Appointment management functionality allows installers to schedule, track, and manage appointments with customers, as well as reminders for upcoming appointments.

3. Customer-Service Issues Tracking: A CRM can track and manage customer-service issues, such as repair or maintenance requests, faulty equipment, or follow-ups necessary post-installation.

4. Document Management: CRM software can store crucial customer documents such as quotes, contracts, invoices and installation reports which can be accessed whenever required.

5. Mobile Access: Given the onsite requirements of such activities, having mobile access to the CRM can provide real-time customer information, project updates, and more to installers on the job.

6. Task Management: A CRM can help manage and assign tasks to specific installers or teams and track the progress until the job's completion.

7. Integration with Accounting Software: This feature allows for easy tracking of budgets, invoices, payments, and overall financial analysis.

8. Sales Forecasts: The CRM can use gathered data to identify potential future sales trends and opportunities for the installation business.

9. Customer Segmentation: CRM can segment customers based on multiple criteria like their needs, preferences, or behavior allowing personalised marketing and services.

10. Communication Management: It can track and manage all communications with a customer, whether via email, phone calls, or social media.

11. Project Management: The system tracks the progress of installation projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget.

12. Inventory Management: CRM integrates with inventory systems to monitor the availability and requirements of hardware and installation equipment.

13. Reporting and Analytics: The software can provide detailed reports and data-driven insights to make informed business decisions.

14. Contract Management: The CRM can keep track of all contracts with customers, including renewals, terms, and conditions, etc.

15. Customer Satisfaction Surveys: Post-installation, CRM can manage customer satisfaction surveys to gather feedback and improve services.
